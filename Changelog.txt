  ALLFALSE: Permission is false everywhere and players are unable to change it in claims
  TRUE: Permission is true in non claimed areas
  FALSE: Permission is false in non claimed areas
  Old configs will get auto converted: false -> ALLFALSE and true -> ALLTRUE

  or via the gui /flan personalGroups.
